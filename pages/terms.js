You have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy;


You are at least 16 years of age, or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to lawfully use navigation and mobility apps;


You have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement; and

If You do not meet these requirements or do not agree with these Terms, You must not use the Services.


3. Overview of the CapturGO Service
CapturGO is a user-owned mobility and mapping network built from encrypted, anonymized movement signals and real-world contributions from everyday users.
The Services may include:
Turn-by-turn navigation and routing


Real-time or near-real-time mobility insights and traffic patterns


Collection of anonymized GPS and sensor signals for map freshness


POI (Point of Interest) verification and updates


Incident reporting (e.g., construction, road closures, hazards)


Rewards in the form of CAPT Points and potentially later conversion opportunities into digital assets (e.g., $CAPT Tokens)


The scope, features, and availability of the Services may change from time to time at our discretion.


4. Accounts and Registration
To access certain features, You may need to create an Account.
You agree to:
provide true, accurate, and complete information during registration;


maintain and promptly update your Account information;


safeguard your login credentials and not share them with others;


accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account.


We may suspend or terminate your Account if we reasonably believe You have:
provided false or misleading information;


violated these Terms or the Privacy Policy;


engaged in fraudulent or harmful behavior; or


compromised the security or integrity of the Services.


You may request Account deletion in accordance with our Privacy Policy.


5. Device Permissions and Location-Based Services
The Services rely on certain Device permissions and technologies, including but not limited to:
Location access (GPS) – for turn-by-turn navigation, traffic understanding, and contribution to the mobility network;


Background location (if enabled by you) – for passive contribution and movement-based rewards while the App runs in the background;


Camera access – for optional POI photos and incident documentation;


Motion and sensor data – such as accelerometer, gyroscope, or other device signals;


Push notifications – for updates about contributions, rewards, and system messages.


You can manage these permissions via your Device settings. Disabling certain permissions may limit functionality, including navigation accuracy or reward earning.
Use and protection of data collected through these permissions is described in detail in our Privacy Policy.


6. Turn-by-Turn Navigation & Safe Driving
6.1 Road Information Prevails
CapturGO provides navigation suggestions, route options, ETAs, and mobility insights ("Navigation Features"). These are assistive tools only.
You acknowledge and agree that:
The information shown in the App does not replace real-world road information.


In all cases, traffic laws, road signs, signals, lane markings, police instructions, and local regulations take precedence over any route suggestion or instruction displayed in the App.


If CapturGO suggests a maneuver that conflicts with posted signs or legal requirements, you must follow the law and ignore the App's suggestion.


6.2 Cautious and Lawful Driving
You are solely responsible for your own driving and for ensuring that your use of the App does not:
distract you from the road;


impair your ability to operate a vehicle safely;


cause you to violate applicable traffic or safety laws.


You must always:
drive vigilantly and adapt to weather, traffic, and road conditions;


obey speed limits and local traffic regulations;


use your judgment when deciding whether to follow suggested routes.


6.3 No Manual Interaction While Driving
It is strictly prohibited to manually interact with the App while driving, including but not limited to:
typing or entering text;


submitting reports or editing POIs;


capturing photos or uploading media;


browsing menus or exploring the map for non-navigation purposes.


You may only submit updates, reports, or photos:
when your vehicle is legally and safely stopped, in accordance with local laws; or


by having a passenger perform the interaction, provided it does not interfere with safe driving.


6.4 Inaccuracy and Non-Continuous Updates
Navigation and mobility data in CapturGO is based on:
user contributions;


GPS and sensor readings;


third-party map and data providers.


As a result, You understand and agree that:
data may be incomplete, outdated, inaccurate, or temporarily unavailable;


traffic or POI conditions may change quickly and may not be reflected in the App;


we do not guarantee accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any routes, ETAs, or traffic information.


You assume full responsibility for any reliance on navigation or mobility data.
6.5 Not for Emergency or Life-Critical Use
CapturGO is not designed or intended for:
emergency routing;


life-critical navigation;


use in medical, aviation, or other safety-critical environments.


In an emergency, You must use official channels (e.g., emergency services, local authorities) and not rely on the App.


7. Connectivity and Data Charges
The Services require an active internet connection (e.g., mobile data, Wi-Fi) for:
downloading maps and updates;


uploading movement signals and reports;


receiving traffic and routing information.


You are solely responsible for:
obtaining and maintaining internet connectivity;


all data, roaming, and carrier charges incurred through your use of the Services.




8. Rewards, CAPT Points, and Tokens
8.1 CAPT Points
You may earn CAPT Points for activities such as:
contributing anonymized movement signals;


verifying POIs or completing micro-tasks;


submitting valid incident reports;


participating in events or campaigns;


referring new Users (where applicable).


CAPT Points:
are not money, legal tender, or a financial instrument;


do not represent ownership, equity, or rights in the Company;


have no guaranteed monetary value;


are subject to change or discontinuation at the Company's discretion.


We may adjust accrual rates, redemption rules, or availability of CAPT Points at any time.
8.2 Token Generation Event and $CAPT Tokens
The Company may in the future conduct a Token Generation Event (TGE) and issue $CAPT Tokens or similar digital assets.
You acknowledge and agree that:
the existence, timing, structure, and terms of any TGE are not guaranteed;


any conversion of CAPT Points into Tokens, if offered, will be governed by separate, specific terms and may require additional eligibility checks (including KYC/AML, where applicable);


conversion rates, caps, or eligibility criteria may be changed, delayed, or cancelled at the Company's discretion.


Nothing in these Terms constitutes financial, legal, or investment advice, or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities or other financial products.


9. Acceptable Use and Restrictions
You agree not to:
use the Services for any illegal, harmful, or unauthorized purpose;


attempt to manipulate, falsify, or "spoof" location or movement data (e.g., GPS spoofing, emulators, automated bots);


interfere with or disrupt the Services or their underlying infrastructure;


upload or submit Content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, obscene, hateful, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable;

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so some of the above limitations may not apply to You. In such cases, the limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.


15. "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer
